## Weather Exposures by Statistical Local Area (SLA)

This dataset was created to represent human exposures to daily weather for use in Environmental Epidemiological studies.The dataset is derived by combining data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) Census Spatial Boundaries with the Bureau of Meteorology Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) Gridded Datasets. 

The meteorological data include rainfall, temperature, vapour pressure and solar exposure and in some cases are available from January 1980 to the present (allowing for a 2 day lag time from the date of request). The spatial data integration has only been stored for the SLAs from the 2001 census (1995-2012), but programs are available to be applied to other editions of the ASGC (or indeed other spatial boundaries) and periods of time as needed.
