title: Excess Heat Indices
---

## Excess Heat Indices example 
During 2011 Ivan Hanigan worked for Geoff Morgan (Geoff.Morgan@ncahs.health.nsw.gov.au) on a consultancy with NSW health to look at heatwaves, mortality and admissions. We use the percentiles of daily max temperature and apparent temperature in a similar way to the paper by Behnoosh Khalaj and Keith Dear. In additional sensitivity analyses we also developed material related to a newly proposed heatwave metric called the Excess Heat Factor by John Nairn at the BoM.

## Some Background

We were asked by our NSW health collaborators to investigate some heatwave indices developed by the BoM. NSW BoM like the look of three indices invented at the SA BoM office (by John Nairn) - they want to construct a national definition. Apparently BoM central HQ like John's definition the most (not published in a journal yet, the best ref is [http://www.cawcr.gov.au/events/modelling_workshops/workshop_2009/papers/NAIRN.pdf](http://www.cawcr.gov.au/events/modelling_workshops/workshop_2009/papers/NAIRN.pdf)).

John has worked with PriceWaterhouseCoopers to apply the heatwave in a recent report [http://www.pwc.com.au/industry/government/assets/extreme-heat-events-nov11.pdf](http://www.pwc.com.au/industry/government/assets/extreme-heat-events-nov11.pdf)
