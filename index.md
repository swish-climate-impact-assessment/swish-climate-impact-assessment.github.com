title: Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Holism
---

# This is the Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Holism (SWISH)
<p></p>
SWISH started as a project for climate change and health impact assessments at the [National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health](http://nceph.anu.edu.au/) (NCEPH) at the Australian National University (ANU).  

The H used to stand for Health, but the scope of the project has grown and so now the H stands for 'Holistic Climate Impact Assessments'.

See the Documentation tab for more information about us and the project.

In brief, the SWISH project consists of a suite of software tools and data packages that we have worked on and leverage off the work of the [https://kepler-project.org/](https://kepler-project.org/), the [http://postgis.refractions.net/](http://postgis.refractions.net/), [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/) and the [http://www.stata.com/](http://www.stata.com/) software systems. Our work includes both an operational web-based research platform as well as enhanced traditional desktop client-side workflows, that boosts our researcher's capacity without compromising our expertise and trusted workflows.  You can read about the other elements of this project at the [Official Project Blog](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.blogspot.com.au/) or this [High Level System Description Document webpage](/HighLevelDescription.html).  From those sites users can explore the scope of the project. This site is devoted to low level descriptions of the software resources included in our project.
