# The Extreme Weather Events Database of the:

    Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Health (SWISH)
<p></p>
project from the [National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health](http://nceph.anu.edu.au/) (NCEPH) at the Australian National University (ANU).  

The SWISH project consists of a suite of software tools that we have worked on and leverage off the work of the [https://kepler-project.org/](https://kepler-project.org/), the [http://postgis.refractions.net/](http://postgis.refractions.net/) and the [http://www.stata.com/](http://www.stata.com/) software systems.

Our work includes both an operational web-based research platform as well as enhanced traditional desktop client-side workflows, that boosts our researcher's capacity without compromising our expertise and trusted workflows.  You can read about the other elements of this project at the [Official Project Blog](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.blogspot.com.au/) or this [High Level System Description Document webpage](/HighLevelDescription.html).  From those sites users can explore the scope of the project. This site is devoted to low level descriptions of the software resources included in our project.
