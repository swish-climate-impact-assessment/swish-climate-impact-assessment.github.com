## A exemplar workflow for geocoding locations
The geocoder workflow at [this clink](/tools/geocoder/geocoder.html) is an example that takes a list of locations and returns a shapefile with the latitude and longitudes, as well as a map.

As you can see when you open the KAR file, this workflow expects an XLSX file to be linked in the first actor.

## list your locations

## run the workflow to create an image

## and a shapefile, stored in your temporary directory
