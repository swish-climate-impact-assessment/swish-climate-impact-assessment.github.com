The [High Level System Description Document](/HighLevelDescription.html) for the Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Health (SWISH) project is now available.  

The project is designed to support climate impact assessment on Human Health. SWISH tools will include methods to chain together tasks that perform operations in the domains of:

- data acquisition, 
- data transformation, 
- mathematical operations, 
- graphing, 
- statistical analysis, and 
- output.  

It will include both an operational web-based research platform as well as enhance traditional desktop client-side workflows, so that it boosts capacity without compromising expertise and trusted workflows. The software ecosystem is summarised in the image below, and fully described at this page [Click Here](/HighLevelDescription.html)

The first demonstration of the system will be the creation of an online validated Extreme Weather Events (EWE) database from historical data that can be queried repeatedly, easily and effectively.

This will be merged with Health, Population and Climate Change scenario data to project future health impacts; and the impact assessment will be able to be easily updated with future additional health, population and weather data; or new Climate Change model versions.  

SWISH is funded by the [Australian National Data Service](http://ands.org.au/)
