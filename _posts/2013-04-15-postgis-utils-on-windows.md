The SWISH EWEDB server is a postgres database with the PostGIS add-on. 
Some of our tools require that the local client computer has some postgres software, but we don't need you to actually install anything.
An easy way to get these tools to work (especially for windows users) is to:

- 1 download the zips from the links below:

[http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg92/postgis-pg92-binaries-2.0.2w64.zip](http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg92/postgis-pg92-binaries-2.0.2w64.zip)

- 2 and unzip them, 
putting the files into:

    C:\pgutils
    

<p></p>
A tutorial with screenshots to make use of the GIS features of the EWEDB will follow in the future.
