Several years ago this was all created to assist the Climate Change and Health projects led by [Tony McMichael out of NCEPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_McMichael).  But since then funding has been difficult to get for Climate Change research in Australia and much of the work on this project fell by the wayside.

Today we are pleased to announce that there is renewed interest in funding for climate change and health research, and especially in relation to health impact assessments (HIA).  

So the SWISH website, tools and servers are all getting rebooted (again).

Stay tuned for more exciting news about our developments of data and tools to assist researchers to more quickly and effectively do health impact assessments for a range of environmental risk factors related to climate change, air pollution and the energy transition.
