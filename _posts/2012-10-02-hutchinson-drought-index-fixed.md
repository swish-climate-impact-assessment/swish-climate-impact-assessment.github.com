The [Hutchinson Drought Index algorithm repository](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex) is set up to download data from an online dataset for use as an example.

Unfortunately the Bureau of Meteorology has recently changed the URLs for these datasets.  

The code available from author Ivan Hanigan's github account is now updated to account for these changes.
