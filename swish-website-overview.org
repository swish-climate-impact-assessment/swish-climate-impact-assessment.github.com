The SWISH EWEDB server is a postgres database with the PostGIS add-on. 
Some of our tools require that the local client computer has some postgres software, but we don't need you to actually install anything.
An easy way to get these tools to work (especially for windows users) is to:

- 1 download the zips from the links below:

[http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgbindownload](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgbindownload)

[http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg92/postgis-pg92-binaries-2.0.2w64.zip](http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg92/postgis-pg92-binaries-2.0.2w64.zip)

- 2 and unzip them, 
putting the files into:

    C:\pgutils
    

<p></p>
A tutorial with screenshots to make use of the GIS features of the EWEDB will follow in the future.

  ## A SWISH testimonial
  Here is what a test user had to say about the EWEDB.
  
  Steve McEachern is Deputy Director of the Australian Data Archive and
  senior research fellow with the Australian Demographic and Social
  Research Institute at the Australian National University.
  
  The Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Health (SWISH)
  provides an enviable collection of research tools for the conduct of
  heath and social science research. The starting point for SWISH is the
  integrated data catalogue, which provides an ideal access point for
  finding and exploring spatial data available through SWISH.
  
  Once data are discovered, the researcher then has the capacity to readily
  access the relevant spatial data through the SWISH Extreme Weather
  Events database (EWEDB). The integration of the Postgres/PostGIS
  database and Geoserver web service for visualisation, along with the
  streamlined access to the spatial data through the Rstudio server
  environment, enable the integration of geospatial data with other survey
  and administrative data sources.
  
  This integration capability allows us to easily bring together data
  sources that have not previously been considered in common, due to the
  level of knowledge required, covering multiple disciplines and research
  methods. In the example presented here, we provide a simple analysis of
  the distribution of drought across NSW in 2006, derived from Bureau of
  Meteorology data, and the vote for the Liberal Party in the same
  electorates in 2010, drawn from the Australian Electoral Commission
  election results website. The correlation between the level of drought
  in 2006 and voting behaviour in 2010 is then shown in the concluding figure.
  
  The integration of the system with GitHub, the DDIIndex data catalogue
  and the SWISH data registry system also enable the research to be fully
  documented, published and then available for reanalysis, further
  demonstrating the potential of the system for supporting reproducible
  research. All of the analysis presented here is available through the
  project GitHub repository.
  
  While the analysis is exploratory only, the use of the SWISH system
  shows the ease with which multiple data sources can be brought together,
  and hence to be able to answer more complex research questions, and at
  increasingly specific levels of geography. Using this system,
  researchers might then consider the effects of weather patterns on
  social phenomena, such as the relationship between seasonal weather
  patterns and depression within local government areas, or extreme
  weather events and social media use.
  I look forward to using this system further in future.
