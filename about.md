# Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Health (SWISH)
The SWISH project is a suite of software tools that we developed and includes both an operational web-based research platform as well as enhanced traditional desktop client-side workflows, that boosts our researcher's capacity without compromising our expertise and trusted workflows.  You can read about the other elements of this project at the [High Level System Description Document webpage](/HighLevelDescription.html).
