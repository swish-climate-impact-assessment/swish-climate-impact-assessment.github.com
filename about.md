# The Extreme Weather Events Database of the:

    Scientific Workflow and Integration Software for Health (SWISH)
<p></p>
project from the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH) at the Australian National University (ANU).  

The SWISH project is a suite of software tools that we developed and includes both an operational web-based research platform as well as enhanced traditional desktop client-side workflows, that boosts our researcher's capacity without compromising our expertise and trusted workflows.  You can read about the other elements of this project at the [High Level System Description Document webpage](/HighLevelDescription.html).

The SWISH project has [a second website devoted to the high level description](http://swish-climate-impact-assessment.blogspot.com.au/). From that site users can explore the scope of the project.
